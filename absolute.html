                Nature is an inherent character or constitution, particularly 
            of the ecosphere or the universe as a whole. In this general 
            sense nature refers to the laws, elements and phenomena of the 
            physical world, including life. Although humans are part of nature, 
            human activity or humans as a whole are often described as at times 
            at odds, or outright separate and even superior to nature.
