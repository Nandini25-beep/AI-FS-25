            Nature is an inherent character or constitution, particularly 
            of the ecosphere or the universe as a whole. In this general 
            sense nature refers to the laws, elements and phenomena of the 
            physical world, including life. Although humans are part of nature, 
            human activity or humans as a whole are often described as at times 
            at odds, or outright separate and even superior to nature.

            During the advent of modern scientific method in the last several centuries, nature became the passive reality, organized and moved 
            by divine laws. With the Industrial Revolution, nature increasingly became seen as the part of reality deprived from intentional intervention: 
            it was hence considered as sacred by some traditions (Rousseau, American transcendentalism) or a mere decorum for divine 
            providence or human history (Hegel, Marx). However, a vitalist vision of nature, closer to the pre-Socratic one, got reborn at the same time, 
            especially after Charles Darwin.

            Within the various uses of the word today, "nature" often refers to geology and wildlife. Nature can refer to the general realm of living beings,
            and in some cases to the processes associated with inanimate objects—the way that particular types of things exist and change of their own accord,
            such as the weather and geology of the Earth. It is often taken to mean the "natural environment" or wilderness—wild animals, rocks, forest, and
            in general those things that have not been substantially altered by human intervention, or which persist despite human intervention. For example, 
            manufactured objects and human interaction generally are not considered part of nature, unless qualified as, for example, "human nature" or "the 
            whole of nature". This more traditional concept of natural things that can still be found today implies a distinction between the natural and the 
            artificial, with the artificial being understood as that which has been brought into being by a human consciousness or a human mind. Depending on 
            the particular context, the term "natural" might also be distinguished from the unnatural or the supernatural.[2]

            The word nature is borrowed from the Old French nature and is derived from the Latin word natura, or "essential qualities, innate disposition", 
            and in ancient times, literally meant "birth".[5] In ancient philosophy, natura is mostly used as the Latin translation of the Greek word physis 
            (φύσις), which originally related to the intrinsic characteristics of plants, animals, and other features of the world to develop of their own 
            accord.[6][7] The concept of nature as a whole, the physical universe, is one of several expansions of the original notion;[2] it began with 
            certain core applications of the word φύσις by pre-Socratic philosophers (though this word had a dynamic dimension then, especially for Heraclitus), 
            and has steadily gained currency ever since.

            Earth has evolved through geological and biological processes that have left traces of the original conditions. The outer surface is divided into 
            several gradually migrating tectonic plates. The interior remains active, with a thick layer of plastic mantle and an iron-filled core that generates
            a magnetic field. This iron core is composed of a solid inner phase, and a fluid outer phase. Convective motion in the core generates electric 
            currents through dynamo action, and these, in turn, generate the geomagnetic field.
            The atmospheric conditions have been significantly altered from the original conditions by the presence of life-forms,[9] which create an ecological 
            balance that stabilizes the surface conditions. Despite the wide regional variations in climate by latitude and other geographic factors, the 
            long-term average global climate is quite stable during interglacial periods,[10] and variations of a degree or two of average global temperature 
            have historically had major effects on the ecological balance, and on the actual geography of the Earth.[11][12]
